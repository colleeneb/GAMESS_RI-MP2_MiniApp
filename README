 An input file is ben_kernel.inp that is the smallest input. 
 You can find bigger inputs at the following link:

 On NVIDIA V100 GPUs, we recommend to use c60, w30, or w60 inputs to see meaningful speedups. 

 1. Submit an interactive job:
    $ bsub -W 1:00 -nnodes 1 -P gen129 -Is $SHELL

 2. Compile the files
    $ make 

 3. Use jsun to run each simple example:
    $ jsrun -n 1 -a 1 -c 1 -g 1 ./test

       -n is the nubmer of resource sets,
       -a is the number of MPI ranks,
       -c is the number of physical cores,
       -g is the number of GPUs

    $ jsrun -n 1 -a 1 -c 1 -g 1 nvprof ./test

     etc.
